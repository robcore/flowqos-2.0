With majority of the world's data and computation handled by cloud-based
systems, cloud management stacks such as Apache's CloudStack, VMware's vSphere
and OpenStack have become an increasingly important component in cloud software.
However, like every other complex distributed system, these cloud stacks are
susceptible to faults, whose root cause is often hard to diagnose. We present
Hansel, a system that leverages non-intrusive network monitoring to expedite root
cause analysis of such faults manifesting in OpenStack operations. Hansel is fast and
accurate, and precise even under conditions of stress.
