\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we validated the results obtained by the original FlowQoS paper ~\cite{Seddiki2014} that demonstrate the isolation of flow traffic based on some high-level classification and bring significant improvement to the performance and user experience for certain packet loss and delay sensitive real-time applications. In addition, we propose an alternate architecture using Linux's traffic control suite's Hierarchical Token Bucket and demonstrate that in general not only it performs at least as well as it's OVS-based counterpart, it can also improve the overall utilization of available bandwidth for the end-host.
