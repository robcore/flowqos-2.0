\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

With majority of the world's data and computation handled by cloud-based
systems, cloud management stacks (CMSes), such as Apache's
CloudStack~\cite{cloudstack}, VMware's vSphere~\cite{vsphere} and
OpenStack~\cite{os}, have become an increasingly important component in the cloud
software. These CMSes are complex, large scale distributed systems enabling
orchestration of tasks, including virtual machine (VM) spawning, termination,
migration, etc. However, like every other distributed system, these CMSes are
susceptible to a variety of complex faults, most of which are often hard to
diagnose even for skilled developers/operators. For example, several
faults~\cite{rackspace-1, rackspace-2, rackspace-3} in Rackspace's cloud
offering based atop OpenStack took several hours or even days to resolve. In this
paper, we focus on the problem of automatically determining the cause of such
hard to diagnose faults manifesting in OpenStack operations.
